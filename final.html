    <h1> Space VR Final Writeup </h1>
    <p>
      Our Space VR project is an alien collection game, where the player is racing against an enemy UFO to collect 3 aliens!
      When you begin, you can see the UFO already racing away towards planets to collection aliens. To play, the user simply drags and rotates the camera, and when they decide on a planet they'd like to land on, they simply center their view on the planet and click, entering them into warpspeed. 
      After warping to the planet, you end up on its surface (a plane) in a new planetary atmosphere. After collecting the alien roaming the plane, the user just has to walk off the plane to leave the planet and start roaming the universe for more aliens. 
      Once the user or the enemy UFO hits 3 aliens collected (as told by the counter kept in the top left corner) the game is over! The counter shows their final score, and is then given the option to continue & restart the game, or can simply close the window to finish.

      As detailed in our 4 writeups, there were several issues varying from rotation, warping, and getting text to show up in the VR world. Fortunately, our issues were resolved relatively quickly, leaving us with a game we were both excited and happy about.
      Here's the outline of our progress, through our writeups:

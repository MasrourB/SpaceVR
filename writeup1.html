    <h1> SpaceVR Writeup 1 </h1>
    <h3> <a href="./index.html"> Current Project </a> </h3>
    <p> Maz and I started with a basic black background with a bunch of white objects, just to start off and test out the virtual environment, as seen in the project proposal </p>
    <div>
      <p> The next step was finding a more accurate background, one that makes you feel like you're in space. I looked through epirectangular images of 'space' on Google (which was a vague query in and of itself) and found an image of a galaxy someone pieced together to form an epirectangular image. I then changed the code such that the same number of planets (350)  were more randomly distributed across a larger range. To do this, I simply raised the max value within the random number generator for the x, y, and z values. At this point we had this: </p>

    <p> Another issue is figuring out which planets have 'life', so to speak. The simplest way to distinguish dead planets from planets with life would generally be with color. So, I set the planets to random colors to see how it would look against the dark background: </p>

    <p> The darker colors are difficult to distinguish against the background, so we will keep the colors light, for planets with life. </p>
  </div>
  <p> We have also implemented y-axis movement for the user, and are testing out rotation and  movement (link above to see planets moving)  </p>
  <p> So, the next steps are randomly selecting planets to be colored (i.e. life!), using OOP to distinguish behavior of non-life planets from planets with life, generating/distributing more planets as the user moves, and determining a 'center' of the universe, or a general goal (maybe find a certain number of planets with life, etc...) </p>
